        <p class="myskills_p">
          I first designed a mock-up of layout for my mobile interface, example where I want the pictures and contents to be which is presented in the design mockup section below.<br>
          For example, I added a menu (dropdown) system for mobile phones which will be elaborated in the detail section.<br>
          After that, I added a breakpoint for desktop devices which will also be elaborated in the detail section.

        <p class="myskills_p">
          I have included a logo and my initial at the top left corner of every page. The logo is a panda which was drawn by me.<br>
          I have also included a copyright in the footer so that people can remember it.<br>
          I am aiming to create a website that is calming, comfortable to see and yet as aesthetic as possible. That's why I have used the color blue a lot throughout all the webpages
          (Another reason is because I love blue colour ! ðŸ¤£)

          The site map is straightforward where all pages will have header navigation and footer navigation which brings
          user to different pages when they click it. Some pages may have one extra navigation link in the main body to bring the user 
          to the page which is relevant to the content.<br>
          The website also applies the three-click rule where user can find what they are interested in within three clicks.

        <h5 class="design-subheading">Details</h5>
        <p class="myskills_p">
          I have used 1 breakpoint and 1 tweak point:<br>
          <span class="specialword">Breakpoint</span>: @media screen and (min-width: 600px)<br>
          I wish to have the same layout and design for mobile devices with 600px as mobile devices with 300px so only one breakpoint is applied.<br>
          600px was chosen because when the screen gets smaller than 600px, fonts will be too small for users to see so I wish to fix the font-size for 
          devices which are less than 600px. <br>
          For mobile devices, pictures in homepage, contact page and degree programme will be below texts rather than aside with texts.<br>
          The 2 rows and 2 columns of content of the homepage will become 1 row and 4 columns in desktop devices.<br>
          Words will be different at breakpoints. For mobile devices, words is fixed at 18px, h1 is 50px, h2 is 28px and h3-h6 are 24px.<br>
          For desktop devices (above 600px), words will get bigger as resolution increases as viewport width is used.<br>
          The margin-left of footer bar will be different as well which is margin-left: 0% for mobile devices and 5% for desktop devices.<br>
          A menu (dropdown) system will be present in mobile devices where lists of header navigation will drop down when users hover over it and 
          the menu system will become normal navigation bar in desktop devices which I did not use any of the examples given 
          in the assignment instructions.<br>
        </p>
        <p class="myskills_p">
          <span class="specialword">Tweak point</span>: @media screen and (max-width: 500px) is for form where words will stack over input column and submit button will cover the whole row.<br>
          This is because when the screen gets to 500px, labels and input areas will be too close together which is not that good to look at.
          The rest of the web pages will be similar (SGA &amp; mySkills, Picture quiz, Accessibility, Legal &amp; Security, Design, Testing).
