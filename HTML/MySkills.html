            The Sheffield Graduate Attributes (SGA) is a presentation of personal attributes and abilities which the university community and external partners
            have agreed are likely to be particularly beneficial to academic success, personal development and employability. This helps students to achieve what they are seeking and
            to adapt to the changing world.
            Students are encouraged to consider their personal development goals and reflects their strengths using mySkills <a class="insidelink2" href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/skills/myskills">mySkills portfolio</a>

            An innovative new way for students to assess, record, build and reflect on your own skills profile. A student's profile and record of personal development will be unique 
            and will be invaluable in creating your CV and strengthening job applications and interview performance.
          </p>
          <p class="myskills_p">
            The first thing to do is a &#39; skills assessment &#39; of some of your current skills and attributes through a multiple-choice questionnaire 
            which consists of 4 statements for each question.
            Roughly takes around 20 minutes to complete, be honest when you're doing it <br>
            Student will see a profile based on his/her answers which highlights their strengths, and he/she will be able to choose which attributes to enhance.<br>
            Student can then start to record his/her experiences and personal development. <br>

              During lectures, we are always given opportunities to think and work out on our own before solutions are given
              which allows me to train my problem-solving skills. Our COM1002 Foundation of Computer Science always needs us to think to 
              fully understand the logic principles behind and I have learnt a lot on how to apply these principles when solving different questions
            </li>
            <li>
              The university always organise campaigns, webinars and workshops to increase our awareness on equality and inclusion
              which helps me to be able to adapt into the international community easier which is undeniably great for international students.
            </li>
            <li>
              The university has a lot of facilities which allow students to carry out their research and innovation. For instance,
              IForge which allows students to create their own things, is certainly one of the most interesting highlights. The diamond
              also has state-of-the-art facilities and equipment for students to have hands-on experience.
